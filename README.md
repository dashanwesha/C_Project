# C Project 1
## The task is to create a program that takes two or more matrices as input (according to the choice of the user) and performs the desired matrix operation as told by the user. The output must be displayed in the form of a well formatted matrix. The matrix operations to be included are: addition, subtraction, multiplication with a scalar, multiplication with a matrix, division by a scalar, division by a matrix, transpose of a matrix, inverseÂ of a matrix.
### This C code provides a set of matrix operations to the user, including addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and transpose. The user is prompted to input the dimensions and elements of the first matrix. Based on the user's choice, the code performs the corresponding operation using the given matrices and displays the result.
### To use the code for matrix operations, follow these steps:
#### 1. Input the matrix dimensions: The program will ask you to input the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
#### 2. Enter matrix elements: Input the elements of the first matrix when prompted.
#### 3. Choose the operation: Select the desired matrix operation from the given options (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for scalar multiplication, 4 for matrix multiplication, or 5 for transpose).
#### 4. Follow additional prompts: Depending on the operation chosen, you may be asked for additional inputs (e.g., elements of the second matrix or a scalar value).
#### 5. View the result: The program will display the result of the chosen matrix operation.
